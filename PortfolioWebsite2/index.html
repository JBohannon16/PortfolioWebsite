											<h3 class="major">SQL Data Exploration</h3>
											<p style="font-size: medium;">Here is the code that I wrote to explore data I found on the Covid-19 pandemic. I used join functions and converted data types to
												efficiently query the data. I used aggregate functions to examine the statistical significance in each area of the data. I used window
												functions and temp tables to present the return data in an significant manner. I finished by examining different contents and got outputs
												that we could compare data from different areas.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Data Visualization with Tabaeu</h3>
											<p style="font-size: medium;">In this project, I took the data from Covid-19 and created a dashboard included various graphs,charts, and maps to interpret 
												it. I created a bar and pie charge to visualy represent the total death numbers by continent. The map is an interactive heatmap 
												of infections per country, followed by a line graph that is a timeline representation of the percent in population that got infected 
												in each country.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Data Cleaning with SQL</h3>
											<p style="font-size: medium;">After downloading raw data about the housing market in Nashville, Tenessee, I used SQL to produce clean and useful
												data that we could use to find significant information. I standardized certain data like the dates and address fields which included
												breaking up the address fields for better filtering and querying. I cleaned out some data by removed duplicates and deleted data
												that was deemed insignificant information.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Correlation with Python</h3>
											<p style="font-size: medium;">This project looks at movies and tests what factors we can find correlation between. We start with cleaning the data by deleting
												any null values and deleting redundencies. After sorting movies by highest gross earnings, we create a couple plot graph showing the gross 
												earnings with the movie's budgets and critic scores. This follows with a correlation matrix between all fields of our data, and this allows
												us to look at what fields have the highest correlations. The project ends with code breaking down the highest contributors to those high
												grossing movies.</p>
